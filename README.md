<p align="justify">
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a web-based version of the classic game, developed responsively using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features the traditional gameplay loop, enhanced with a win streak counter to track consecutive wins, localStorage for persistent game data across sessions, and an autoplay mode to watch the CPU play itself. Additionally, users can view their game statistics and easily reset all data to start fresh.

# Challenges and Solutions

This was my first time making any kind of game, so I thought the best way to learn was to make it using tools and software I was already comfortable. So, I decided to make this Rock, Paper, Scissors game web-based so I could focus on learning game logic. The hardest part was getting localStorage to work and making the autoplay feature. I didn't realize how much I would backtrack and have to re-read my code over and over again. This realization led me to making my code neat, organized, and well-commented.
